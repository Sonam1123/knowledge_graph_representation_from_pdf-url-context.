# Knowledge Graph Representation from PDF/URL/Text
This project is a comprehensive web-based application aimed at automatically generating Knowledge Representation Graphs from various forms of unstructured content. The tool is designed to handle three main types of input: PDF documents, content extracted from web URLs, and text manually entered by users. These sources are often rich in information but presented in formats that are not always easy to understand or analyze directly. To address this, the application utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and graph theory to transform raw text into structured, interpretable visual representations.

At the core of the system is an NLP engine powered by spaCy, which is responsible for identifying important textual elements such as Named Entities (e.g., names of people, organizations, places, and key terms) and grammatical relationships (such as subject-verb-object patterns or adjective-noun connections). These linguistic features help the system pinpoint meaningful concepts and determine how they are related within the context of the content.

Once the relevant entities and relationships are extracted, the system leverages graph theory, implemented using the NetworkX library, to create a visual graph structure. In this graph, each concept or entity becomes a node, and the relationships or co-occurrences between them are represented as edges. This graphical structure provides a high-level abstraction of the underlying text, making it easier to analyze and understand.

The main advantage of this approach is that it allows users to visually explore complex information. Instead of reading through lengthy documents or web pages, users can see an interconnected map of ideas, which highlights the most important concepts and how they influence or relate to each other. This is particularly useful in educational settings, where students can use the graph to understand textbook chapters more effectively, or in research, where scholars can quickly identify the key contributions and themes of a paper.

Additionally, this graphical representation supports semantic analysis by showing how ideas are connected and clustered, enabling deeper insight into the contentâ€™s structure. In summary, this project transforms unstructured textual data into structured, visual knowledge graphs, helping users make sense of information more efficiently and intuitively.

# Features
1. PDF Content Extraction
Uses pdfplumber to extract clean and readable text from PDF documents while ignoring headers, footers, and non-informative elements.

2. URL Content Scraping
Employs BeautifulSoup to fetch and clean article-like content from a given website link, stripping away HTML tags and irrelevant content.

3. Direct Text Input Support
Allows users to manually enter or paste any text content via a web form to generate the graph.

4. Entity and Relation Extraction with spaCy
Applies NLP techniques using spaCy to identify Named Entities (e.g., people, organizations, places) and syntactic relationships between words to form semantic structures.

5. Graph Construction Using NetworkX
Converts extracted entities and their connections into nodes and edges using the NetworkX library, forming a clear conceptual map of the content.

6. Graph Visualization
Renders the graph either as a static image (Matplotlib) or interactive network (Pyvis/Plotly) on the webpage, enabling intuitive exploration of the knowledge structure.

7. Django-Based Web Application
Built with the Django framework, offering a user-friendly interface to interact with all features including file uploads, text input, and graph viewing.

# How It Works
1. Input Phase
The user uploads a PDF file, submits a web URL, or types/pastes text into a form.

2. Text Extraction & Preprocessing
The system reads and cleans the content using appropriate methods (pdfplumber for PDFs, BeautifulSoup for URLs, plain text handling for direct input).
The text is tokenized and lemmatized to remove noise and unify word forms.

3. Information Extraction (NLP)
spaCy is used to identify Named Entities (like people, locations, concepts) and determine grammatical dependencies between words.
Co-occurrence patterns and syntactic roles are used to infer relationships.

4. Graph Generation
Using NetworkX, the extracted entities become nodes, and the detected relationships become edges.
Edge weights may be assigned based on frequency or contextual strength.

5. Graph Visualization & Explanation
A graph is rendered on the webpage using Matplotlib or Pyvis.
A textual summary accompanies the graph to explain its structure and key concepts.

#  Use Cases
1. Educational Concept Mapping
Automatically break down textbook chapters or lecture notes into visual knowledge maps to enhance student understanding.

2. Research Paper Visualization
Visualize key ideas and relationships in academic papers for faster comprehension and literature reviews.

3. Document Summarization
Highlight the most important concepts in long documents and their interconnections in a condensed visual form.

4. Content Understanding & Exploration
Explore dense or unfamiliar content visually to uncover hidden relationships and gain insights into the subject matter.
