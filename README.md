# Knowledge Graph Representation from PDF/URL/Text
This project automatically extracts meaningful concepts from input content (PDF file, website URL, or direct text) and visualizes them as a Knowledge Representation Graph using NLP techniques and graph theory.

# Features
1. Extracts text from PDF documents
2. Scrapes and cleans content from website URLs
3. Accepts direct text input via a form
4. Uses NLP (spaCy) to extract entities and relationships
5. Builds a concept graph using NetworkX
6. Displays an interactive or static graph on the web
7. Web-based interface using Django

# How It Works
1. Upload a PDF, enter a URL, or type content directly
2. The backend extracts and cleans the content
3. Named Entities and Relations are extracted using spaCy
4. A graph is created based on entity co-occurrences or dependencies
5. The graph is rendered and displayed along with an explanation

#  Use Cases
1. Educational Concept Mapping
2. Research Paper Visualization
3. Document Summarization
4. Content Understanding and Exploration
